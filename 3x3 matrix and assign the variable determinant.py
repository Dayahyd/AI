#calculate determinant of 3x3 matrix using tensorflow and assign the variable determinant value for evaluation of test cases


import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Define the 3x3 matrix as a TensorFlow constant or variable.
# We'll use tf.constant for this example, which is sufficient as the matrix is not changing.
matrix_3x3 = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
                         [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
                         [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]], dtype=tf.float32)

# Step 2: Use tf.linalg.det() to compute the determinant.
# This function returns a tensor with the determinant value.
determinant_tensor = tf.linalg.det(matrix_3x3)

# Step 3: Extract the value from the tensor and assign it to a standard Python variable.
# The .numpy() method is used to get the value in a NumPy format,
# which can be treated as a standard Python number.
determinant_value = determinant_tensor.numpy()

# You can now print the variable to verify the result.
print(f"The 3x3 matrix is:\n{matrix_3x3.numpy()}")
print(f"\nThe determinant as a TensorFlow tensor is: {determinant_tensor}")
print(f"\nThe final determinant value is assigned to a standard Python variable: {determinant_value}")

# You can now use `determinant_value` in your test cases.
# For example, to check if it's close to zero.
assert np.isclose(determinant_value, 0.0), "The determinant is not close to zero."

#Explanation
#tf.constant(): This creates a TensorFlow tensor to represent your matrix. Using a tf.Variable is also an option, but for a fixed matrix, a constant is more appropriate.
#tf.linalg.det(): This is the core function from TensorFlow's linear algebra module that computes the determinant of the input matrix.
#.numpy(): In TensorFlow 2.x (with eager execution enabled by default), you can directly extract the value from a tensor by calling the .numpy() method. This converts the TensorFlow tensor into its NumPy representation, which is a standard Python data type.
#determinant_value: This is the final Python variable holding the numerical value of the determinant, which can be used for evaluation, test cases, or any other standard Python operations.
